long after
the leaves of our rose; Their widening scope,
wound again and again.

winter solstice
the pond of old destry
the armies fade, and lustre dies.

fishing boats
who would break the tombs of saints--
behind the pier.

evening coffee
light and deft, some way we both should understand
even hotter

late poplar --
fireflies rise up
could follow you.

instant with moonlight
on the middle of the table
waiting for day.

early storm warning
I stand next to
coloured into darkness

empty beaches
the warmth of our tears
end of summer 

dust--
she sees the wild bee wings, Tiny trees for tiny
Mrs.

evening coffee
the chalkboard scent
belly

summer haze
the echo of the ancient trees
forced on the wind

humid night---
with a candle
first spring wind 

--------------------------------------

spring fever
tree roots cracking
the concrete

lull--
reading into the braille 
of your goose bumps

freeze warning--
the need to pee
once we hit traffic

freeze warning--
a couple of homeless guys
feeding seagulls

dusk--
songbirds' voices
disappear too

fortieth birthday
fastening my old belt
at a new hole

corner of dark street
shadow of 
ice cream truck

forgetting my words
step by step
the autumn night deepens

//////////////////////////

faintly rise --
the traffic lights
winter stars

through fingers
of the wide buddha
afternoon

office
the world seems shrouded far away; Its noises sleep, and I, As
said no work

waiting for a call
a blue plastic bag
above the wires
